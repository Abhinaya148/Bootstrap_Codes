    <div class="col-md-8 bg-light"><b>The Indian President</b>

    <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, (born Oct. 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, 
        Shillong), Indian president (2002–07). After graduating from the Madras Institute of
         Technology, Kalam played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear
          weapons programs. He planned a program that produced a number of successful missiles, 
          helping earn him the nickname “Missile Man.”</p>
    <div class="container text-bg-primary">Beginning in the early 1990s, he also
         served as scientific adviser to the government, and his prominent role in
          India’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests established Kalam as a national hero.
           In 2002 the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) National Democratic Alliance
            nominated Kalam, a Muslim, to succeed outgoing President K.R. Narayanan.
             Kalam easily won the elections in 2002, and in the largely ceremonial post he
              sought to use science and technology to transform India into a developed country.
               In 2007 he was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.</div>
    <h1 class="container mt-5 text-success">Career As A Scientist</h1>
    <p>In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia;
         Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.
         Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite 
         Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful</p>
         <img src="img.jpg" class="rounded" width="200px" height="200px">
    <p>Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of 
        the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. 
        The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an
         intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator,
          along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.Media coverage of Kalam 
          during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist.
          However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear
           bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.
           Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.</p>
